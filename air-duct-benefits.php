                                    <li><strong>Energy Efficiency and Savings:</strong> A mere .042 inches of dirt on a
                                        heating coil can lead to a 21% reduction in efficiency, according to the EPA.

                                        footprint.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Prolonged Equipment Life:</strong> Did you know that 9 out of 10 system
                                        failures are caused by dirt and dust? Your heating and cooling system's fan
                                        keeps the heat exchanger cool, but accumulated dirt can cut the airflow
                                        significantly. This strain is a common cause of heat exchanger cracks. Our
                                        cleaning services can prevent premature breakdowns and extend the lifespan of
                                        your system, saving you from costly replacements.</li>
